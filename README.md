# ZoneCalc
Calculate Power Zones, Heart Rate Zones, and Pace Zones for Triathlete


# Application
0.2.0 - Added Laps for swimming so you can see how long a "Steady" 400 yard/meter would be.

0.1.0  -  Create Running and Swimming Zones page.  Also extracted all the zone data into .json files that can be edited by the user.  The home page sorts the sports in the "triathlon" order (swim, bike, run).  On the Swim Zone page you can enter a time in either yards or meters, and then convert your time to the opposite.

0.0.1  -  Created Cycling Zones


# Build
This is an angular application, if you clone this from github run "npm install" to download all the npm packages, and then run "npm -g install @angular/cli" to download the angular cli (I'm not sure why this doesn't come with the "npm install" command).  Then run "ng serve" and you will have a web server up running the application
