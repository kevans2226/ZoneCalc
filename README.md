# Build
This is an angular application, if you clone this from github run "mpm install" to download all the npm packages, and then run "npm -g install @angular/cli" to download the angular cli (I'm not sure why this doesn't come with the "npm install" command).  Then run "ng serve" and you will have a web server up running the application
